# Number Guessing Game
Welcome to my try on a python-based Number Guessing Game. This program chooses a random number between 1 and 100 and allows you to take 10 guesses to guess that number. This is one of my first serious tries on writing a structured Python project, hope you enjoy it!

## Running the project
To run the project:
```
python src/main.py
```

## Features
- Utilising a logic system that evaluates each of the answers and determines wether it's correct and wrong
- A hinting system that let's you know if your guess is higher or lower than the correct answer
- A scoring system that penalises each wrong answer counting down from 10 to 1, and prints out the final score once the guess is successful
- Providing the option to quit the game at any point by typing in "quit" or "q"
